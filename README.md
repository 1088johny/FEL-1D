# FEL-1D

The fel.f90 is a FORTRAN code to solve the one dimensional dynamics of the Free-Electron-Laser (FEL) interaction using a quantum fluid description in the paraxial aproximation. The code computes the FEL ressonance condition and solves the dynamics by using a fourth order Runge-Kutta method.

The results of this code were used for the following publications:
